&nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University, Machine Learning Department, working with Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and Prof. [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/) on *online decision making*.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently got my PhD in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. [Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that, I got my B.S. from Tsinghua University in 2019, advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liguoqi).

&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I just got my PhD in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that, I got my B.S. (in Measurement & Control) from Tsinghua University in 2019, where I am advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liguoqi).

&nbsp; &nbsp; Starting FALL 2024, I will be joining Carnegie Mellon University, Machine Learning Department as a postdoc, working with Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and Prof. [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/) on *societal decision making*.


&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang. Before that, I got my B.S. from Tsinghua University in 2019.

&nbsp; &nbsp; My current **research interest** is dynamic pricing. My goal is to seek for statistical and discrete-mathematical methods to improve our comprehension on the price-demand relationships in the market.

&nbsp; &nbsp; My <u>research interest</u> lies broadly in **statistical machine learning** and **online learning** problems. My most recent projects are on *dynamic pricing*. Besides, I also worked on graph theory and computational complexity during my undergraduate.

&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that, I got my B.S. (in Measurement & Control) from Tsinghua University in 2019, where I am advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liguoqi).

<!-- 
&nbsp; &nbsp; My current **research interest** is dynamic pricing. My goal is to seek for statistical and discrete-mathematical methods to improve our comprehension on the price-demand relationships in the market.
-->

&nbsp; &nbsp; My <u>research interest</u> lies broadly in statistical machine learning and online decision-making, with emphasis in **dynamic pricing** problems. Besides, I also worked on graph theory and computational complexity during my undergraduate. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Starting FALL 2024, I will be joining Carnegie Mellon University, Machine Learning Department as a postdoc, working with Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and Prof. [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/) on *societal decision making*.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Please find my latest CV [here](/files/CV_Jianyu_Xu_2405.pdf).

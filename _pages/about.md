&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that I got my B.S.E. at Tsinghua University in 2019.

<!--, where I am fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/) and [Prof. Zheng Zhang](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~zhengzhang/).   Before that I was with the Department of Precision Instrument and the Brain-inspired Computing Center in Tsinghua University and had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](http://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/liguoqi.html).<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a variety of **research interests**, including: dynamic pricing, multi-armed/contextual bandits, tensor networks, computational complexity, etc. My current work is a combination of pricing and bandits problem. -->

&nbsp; &nbsp; My current **research interest** is dynamic pricing. My goal is to seek for statistical and computational methods to improve our comprehension on market process while also applying information theory to show the limitations. During my undergraduate, I spent some time on tensors and computational complexity.

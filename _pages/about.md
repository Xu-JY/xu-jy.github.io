&nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Machine Learning Department (MLD) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am fortunately working with Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and Prof. [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/).

&nbsp;&nbsp; I got my PhD in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara in 2024, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu-Xiang Wang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that, I got my B.S. from Tsinghua University in 2019, fortunately advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liguoqi).

&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I just got my PhD in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that, I got my B.S. (in Measurement & Control) from Tsinghua University in 2019, where I am advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~liguoqi).

&nbsp; &nbsp; Starting FALL 2024, I will be joining Carnegie Mellon University, Machine Learning Department as a postdoc, working with Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and Prof. [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/) on *societal decision making*.


&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang. Before that, I got my B.S. from Tsinghua University in 2019.

&nbsp; &nbsp; My current **research interest** is dynamic pricing. My goal is to seek for statistical and discrete-mathematical methods to improve our comprehension on the price-demand relationships in the market.
-->


&nbsp; &nbsp; My <u>research interest</u> lies broadly in **on-line machine learning** and **learning theory** problems. Currently I am developing online decision-making strategies in *constrained generative* scenarios. During my PhD (and ongoing), I have been doing a series of work on *dynamic pricing*. Besides, I also worked on graph theory and combinatorics out of personal interests.

&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/) and [Prof. Zheng Zhang](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~zhengzhang/). Before that I was with the Department of Precision Instrument and the Brain-inspired Computing Center in Tsinghua University and had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](http://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/liguoqi.html).<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a variety of **research interests**, including: dynamic pricing, multi-armed/contextual bandits, tensor networks, computational complexity, etc. My current work is a combination of pricing and bandits problem.

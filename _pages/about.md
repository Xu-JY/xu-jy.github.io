&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am fortunately being advised by [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that I got my B.S.E. at Tsinghua University in 2019.


&nbsp; &nbsp; My current **research interest** is dynamic pricing. My goal is to seek for statistical and discrete-mathematical methods to improve our comprehension on the price-demand relationships in the market.

<!-- 
&nbsp; &nbsp; My <u>research interest</u> lies broadly in **statistical machine learning** and **online decision-making**, with emphasis in **dynamic pricing** and **bandits** problems. My [most recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11837.pdf) is on the fairness of pricing. Besides, I also worked on tensors and computational complexities during my undergraduate. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Please find my latest CV [here](/files/CV_Jianyu_Xu_2022.pdf).

&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science, and I joined UCSB for my graduate study since Sept 2019. My academic and research advisors are [Prof. Zheng Zhang](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~zhengzhang/) and [Prof. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/). Before that I was with the Department of Precision Instrument and the Brain-inspired Computing Center in Tsinghua University and was advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](http://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/liguoqi.html).<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a variety of **research interests**, including: dynamic pricing, multi-armed/contextual bandits, tensor networks, computational complexity, etc.
